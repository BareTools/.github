## 🧰 Bare Tools

**Bare Tools** is a suite of focused tools to solve real problems with minimal bloat.

We believe in **pragmatism**, **freedom**, and **simplicity**.  
We write software that respects users, prioritizes clarity, and avoids unnecessary complexity.

### 🔧 What We Build

- Tools that are **lightweight**, **open source**, and **minimalist**.
- Apps that solve **specific problems** without trying to do everything.
- Solutions that are easy to **understand**, **modify**, and **maintain**.

---

### ✨ Principles We Follow

- **Less is more**: Avoid feature creep. Focus on core functionality.
- **Freedom matters**: Our tools are open, forkable, and modifiable.
- **Hackable by design**: Everything we build is meant to be understood and changed by users.
- **Respect the user**: No trackers, no forced updates, no dark patterns.
